# Project Title: FIR Complaint System Using Blockchain

# Team Name: THE CYBER SQUAD

*Admin*: VAIBHAV BABELE

*Objective*: The primary objective of this project is to create a decentralized and transparent FIR (First Information Report) complaint system leveraging the power of blockchain technology. The system aims to ensure the integrity and security of FIR records, making them tamper-proof and easily accessible.

*Introduction*:
The traditional FIR filing system is often plagued by inefficiencies, delays, and the potential for manipulation. To address these challenges, THE CYBER SQUAD has embarked on developing a blockchain-based FIR complaint system. This innovative approach will not only streamline the process but also enhance the trustworthiness and transparency of the data.

*Project Overview*:
Our FIR complaint system utilizes blockchain technology to record FIRs in a secure and immutable manner. Each FIR is treated as a transaction that, once recorded on the blockchain, cannot be altered or deleted. This ensures the authenticity of the complaint and protects it from any unauthorized modifications.

*Key Features*:
1. *Decentralization*: The use of blockchain eliminates the need for a central authority, distributing data across a network of nodes.
2. *Transparency*: All records are accessible to authorized parties, ensuring transparency in the FIR filing and retrieval process.
3. *Security*: Blockchain's cryptographic nature provides a high level of security, protecting FIR data from tampering.
4. *Immutability*: Once an FIR is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered, ensuring the integrity of the information.
5. *Accessibility*: Authorized users can access FIR records from anywhere, at any time, facilitating a more efficient complaint management system.

*Development Process*:
The project was divided into various phases, including requirement gathering, system design, blockchain integration, front-end development, testing, and deployment. Each team member contributed significantly to these phases, from coding and debugging to documentation and user interface design.

*Conclusion*:
The blockchain-based FIR complaint system developed by THE CYBER SQUAD represents a significant advancement in the way FIRs are managed. By combining the expertise of our team members and the leadership of Vaibhav Babele, we have created a robust, secure, and transparent system that promises to revolutionize the FIR filing process. This project not only showcases our technical skills but also our commitment to leveraging technology for societal benefit.

# Project dependencies:
yarn add @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers react-hot-toast

# Steps to run this project:
1. Git clone this repo
2. Install the project dependencies
3. Create a .env.local file inside the main folder
4. Add a variable by the name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SMART_CONTRACT
5. Deploy this contract directly from the this Thirdweb Link: http://bit.ly/3VeNU6h
6. While deploying you will have to fill the constructor argument with an address for officer's address(suggestion: should be separate from deployer's address)
7. Copy the smart contract address and assign it to NEXT_PUBLIC_SMART_CONTRACT that you had created
8. Open terminal and run command: yarn dev
